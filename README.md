# Evolutionary Algorithms for Automatically Learning Guitar Pedal Effects

This repository presents a method for automatically reconstructing guitar pedal effects chains from audio recordings. 
The approach leverages genetic algorithms (GAs) to effectively identify the types of effects applied and estimate their corresponding parameter settings, even in the presence of multiple, interacting effects. 
The proposed method combines signal processing techniques for peak detection and spectrogram analysis with the GA-based optimization framework to tackle this non-trivial audio processing task. 
By harnessing the optimization capabilities of GAs, this system aims to enable a variety of applications including music transcription, sound emulation, and generative music systems.
